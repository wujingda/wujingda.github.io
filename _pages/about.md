I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in the School of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at Nanyang Technological University (NTU). I am working in the [Automated Driving and Human-Machine System (AutoMan) Lab](https://lvchen.wixsite.com/automan), and supervised by [Prof Chen Lv](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=UKVs2CEAAAAJ&hl=en).

I focus on the intersection between reinforcement learning (RL) and autonomous electrified vehicle. My Ph.D. study aims to harness human intelligence to optimize the training cost and performance of reinforcement learning algorithms. In particular, my research points include behavior decision-making and planning of autonomous vehicles and energy management of electrified vehicles. I have published more than 20 papers in top journals and conferences.

[Prioritized Experience-based Reinforcement Learning with Human Guidance for Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.12516), **Jingda Wu**, Zhiyu Huang, Wenhui Huang, Chen Lv

**IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems, 2022** \| [**Project**](https://github.com/wujingda/Prioritized-Human-in-the-loop-End-to-end-Autonomous-Driving)
-  We propose a priority experience utilization method in the context of human guidance-based off-policy reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, in which we establish an advantage measurement to highlight high-value human guidance data over the mixed experience buffer with both human demonstration and RL experience.

[Towards Human-in-the-loop AI: Enhancing Deep Reinforcement Learning via Real-time Human Guidance for Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/2104/2104.07246.pdf), **Jingda Wu**, Zhiyu Huang, Zhongxu Hu, Chen Lv

**Engineering, 2022** \| [**Project**](https://github.com/wujingda/Human-in-the-loop-Deep-Reinforcement-Learning) 
-  We propose a real-time human guidance-based deep reinforcement learning method for improving policy training performance. The newly designed actor-critic architecture enabled the DRL policy to approach human guidance, and a 40 subjects-involved human-in-the-loop experimental validation confirms its superior performance for end-to-end autonomous driving cases.

[Uncertainty-Aware Model-Based Reinforcement Learning with Application to Autonomous Driving](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9802913), **Jingda Wu**, Zhiyu Huang, Chen Lv

**IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicle, 2022**
- We propose an uncertainty-aware model-based RL method to improve the performance in the context of highly uncertain environment models. Based on an action-conditioned ensemble model, we develop an adaptive truncation approach to determine the utilization extent of the environment model and improve RL‚Äôs training efficiency and performance.
