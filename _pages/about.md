<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in the School of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at Nanyang Technological University (NTU). I am working in the [Automated Driving and Human-Machine System (AutoMan) Lab](https://lvchen.wixsite.com/automan), and supervised by [Prof Chen Lyu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=UKVs2CEAAAAJ&hl=en).

I focus on the intersection between human-machine learning cooperation and autonomous electrified vehicle. My Ph.D. study aims to harness human intelligence to optimize the training cost and performance of reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. In particular, my research points include behavior decision-making and planning of autonomous vehicles and energy management of electrified vehicles. I have published more than 20 papers in top journals and conferences.

[Prioritized Experience-based Reinforcement Learning with Human Guidance for Autonomous Driving] (https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/2109/2109.12516.pdf), **Jingda Wu**, Zhiyu Huang, Wenhui Huang, and Chen Lv

**IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems, (Early Access)**
-  We propose a priority experience utilization method in the context of human guidance-based off-policy reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, in which we establish an advantage measurement to highlight high-value human guidance data over the mixed experience buffer with both human demonstration and RL experience.

[Towards Human-in-the-loop AI: Enhancing Deep Reinforcement Learning via Real-time Human Guidance for Autonomous Driving] (https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/2104/2104.07246.pdf), **Jingda Wu**, Zhiyu Huang, Zhongxu Hu, and Chen Lv

**IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems, 2022** \| [**Project**](https://mczhi.github.io/Expert-Prior-RL/) \| [![](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/MCZhi/Expert-Prior-RL?style=social&label=Code Stars)](https://github.com/MCZhi/Expert-Prior-RL)
-  We propose a real-time human guidance-based deep reinforcement learning (Hug-DRL) method for improving policy training performance. The newly designed actor-critic architecture enabled the DRL policy to approaching human guidance, and a 40 subjects-involved human-in-the-loop experimental validation confirm its the superior performance for end-to-end autonomous driving cases.

[Driving Behavior Modeling using Naturalistic Human Driving Data with Inverse Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.03118.pdf), **Zhiyu Huang**, Jingda Wu, Chen Lv

**IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems, 2021** \| [![](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/MCZhi/Driving-IRL-NGSIM?style=social&label=Code Stars)](https://github.com/MCZhi/Driving-IRL-NGSIM)
- We propose a structural assumption about internal reward function-based human driving behavior and employ sampling-based maximum entropy inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) algorithm to infer the reward function parameters from naturalistic human driving data.
